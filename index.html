                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">D Block Catalytic Property</h3>
                <p>Transition metals (d-block elements) often act as catalysts due to their ability to change oxidation states and form complex ions. Their partially filled d-orbitals allow them to interact with reactants effectively, lowering the activation energy of reactions.</p>

            <div class="mb-4">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Metallic Character</h3>
                <p>Metallic character refers to the tendency of an element to lose electrons and form positive ions. In the d-block, metallic character increases down the group and decreases across a period. Transition metals exhibit high metallic character due to their ability to conduct electricity and heat.</p>

            <div class="mb-4">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Electronic Configuration</h3>
                <p>The electronic configuration of d-block elements typically follows the pattern of filling the 3d orbitals after the 4s orbital. For example, the electronic configuration of Iron (Fe) is [Ar] 3d<sup>6</sup> 4s<sup>2</sup>.</p>

                <p>Both KMnO<sub>4</sub> (Potassium permanganate) and K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (Potassium dichromate) are strong oxidizing agents. They can be used in redox reactions, where they oxidize various organic and inorganic substances. For example, in acidic medium, KMnO<sub>4</sub> can oxidize alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids.</p>

            <div class="mb-4">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Colligative Properties</h3>
                <p>These properties depend on the number of solute particles in a solution rather than the identity of the solute. Key colligative properties include boiling point elevation, freezing point depression, vapor pressure lowering, and osmotic pressure. They are important in understanding how solutes affect the physical properties of solvents.</p>

                    <li>Magnetic quantum number (m<sub>l</sub>): Indicates the orientation of the orbital.</li>
                    <li>Spin quantum number (m<sub>s</sub>): Indicates the spin of the electron.</li>

                <p>The Nernst equation relates the cell potential of an electrochemical cell to the standard electrode potential, temperature, and concentrations of the reactants and products. It is given by:</p>
                <p class="italic">E = E<sup>°</sup> - (RT/nF) ln Q</p>
                <p>Where E is the cell potential, E<sup>°</sup> is the standard cell potential, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, n is the number of moles of electrons, F is Faraday's constant, and Q is the reaction quotient.</p>

                <p><strong>Zero Order Reactions:</strong> The rate of reaction is constant and independent of the concentration of reactants. The rate law is given by: Rate = k.</p>
                <p><strong>First Order Reactions:</strong> The rate of reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of one reactant. The rate law is given by: Rate = k[A].</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Arrhenius Theory</h3>
                <p>The Arrhenius theory explains how temperature affects the rate of chemical reactions. It states that the rate of a reaction increases with an increase in temperature due to more molecules having sufficient energy to overcome the activation energy barrier. The Arrhenius equation is:</p>
                <p class="italic">k = A e<sup>-E<sub>a</sub>/RT</sup></p>
                <p>Where k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, E<sub>a</sub> is the activation energy, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.</p>
